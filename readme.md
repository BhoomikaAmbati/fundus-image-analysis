## Key Components

### ðŸ”¹ **Data Handling**

- `Data/` â†’ Contains the augmented dataset used for training.
- `new_data/` â†’ Contains the original, unaltered dataset.

### ðŸ”¹ **Model Training**

- `train/train.py` â†’ Loads the augmented dataset, trains the model, and saves it as `model/model.h5`.
- `train/metrics.py` â†’ Computes training metrics and logs progress.

### ðŸ”¹ **Model Evaluation**

- `validation/eval.py` â†’ Evaluates the trained model on validation data and stores results in `results/validation_results/`.

### ðŸ”¹ **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

- `pca/` â†’ Scripts for PCA computation on hidden layer outputs.
- Outputs stored in `results/pca_results/`.

### ðŸ”¹ **Model Architecture**

- `unet_model_summary.pdf` â†’ Provides a summary of the U-Net model architecture.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ProjectRoot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```sh
   python train/train.py
   ```
4. Validate the model:
   ```sh
   python validation/eval.py
   ```
5. Perform PCA analysis:
   ```sh
   python pca/pca_analysis.py
   ```

## ðŸ“œ Notes

- The training process generates a trained model (`model/model.h5`).
- Validation results are stored under `results/validation_results/`.
- PCA analysis is performed on hidden layer outputs and results are stored in `results/pca_results/`.
